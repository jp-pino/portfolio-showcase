As a final project for the course EE445M "Embedded and Real-Time Operating Systems Laboratory" at UT Austin, [Cole Morgan](https://github.com/coleamorgan) and I started developing our own RTOS implementation. [mopiOS](https://github.com/jp-pino/mopiOS) is still a work in progress and I'm currently working on porting it to other microcontrollers and adding more functionality to it.
